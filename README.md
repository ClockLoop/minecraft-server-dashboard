Development status
--------
This was an old high school/first year uni project and won't be update much anymore. Of course, if something is desparately broken I (or perhaps you!) may be able to fix that.

However, I have ported the core parts of the program to C# - see the [c-sharp-branch](https://github.com/navhaxs/minecraft-server-dashboard/tree/c-sharp-branch) of this repo if you're interested. The goal of the C# branch is to have better code quality (e.g. MVVM) and support for localisation (translation).

Thanks to all the users and support over the years!
