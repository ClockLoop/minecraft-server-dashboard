Minecraft Server Dashboard==========================A pretty frontend for hosting a Minecraft server from home..This branch is the C# rewrite of Dashboard, which aims to:- Make Dashboard easier to translate.- Make use of the Model-View-ViewModel pattern.- Provide its own WPF styles for theming, without using an external style library. Like the AirDroid or Pushbullet client apps for Windows.- Unit testing where appropriate?Currently targetting .NET Framework 4 for Windows XP compatibility.Building--------Add git.exe to your PATHOpen MinecraftServerDashboard.sln (from the root directory) in Visual Studio.Build the solution.NuGet will automatically restore the package dependencies.Source code directories-------There are three subdirectories:* **MinecraftServerDashboard** - Legacy VB.NET source code.* **DummyApp** - A test program that simply prints out text to stdout, using some sample server console output. Use as a substitute to java.exe when debugging :)* **DashboardApp** - Effort to rewrite in C#.License-------GNU General Public License, version 2 or later.## AttributionsDotNetZip http://dotnetzip.codeplex.com (Ms-PL)Roger Vuistiner's MWLib (CPOL) -- Provides smoother scrolling; not very useful and may be removed in the future.Json.NET http://james.newtonking.com/json (MIT)
